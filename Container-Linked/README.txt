PushBack:
This adds an element to the end of the list. It is like the append() method on a slice.

Slice
PushFront:
Inserts an element at the front of the list. This shows the advantage of using a container listâ€”inserting at the front is fast.

Front, Next:
These funcs are used to iterate through the list. Iteration in a container list will be slower than in a slice or array.
